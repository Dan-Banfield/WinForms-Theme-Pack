## Usage
Varies. Select your theme, import the .cs file to your project, build and check if there are any missing references or errors. You may need to include Theme Base 1.5.2, 1.5.3 or 1.5.4 (included) in your project as well.

Selected Theme/controls should appear in the toolbox after building or doing a rebuild. If not, remember to reference the theme file in your main form (ex:Form1) and restart Visual Studio.


No guarantees; themes are collected from multiple sources and some may not work correctly. Original file names kept unchanged
